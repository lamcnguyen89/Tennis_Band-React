                Weâ€™re a husband and wife team by the names of Alaina Moore and
                Patrick Riley. We met, fell in love, and married after meeting
                in a philosophy className at the University of Colorado. After
                graduating from college, we undertook an 8-month long sailing
                expedition to figure out our lives and vision.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's a spiritual teacher named Osho. In one of his books, he
                says that before a man and woman get married, they should first
                be made to go on a honeymoon together and be stuck with only
                each other for company for many months. If they can make it
                through this ordeal without hating eachother... Then they can
                marry.
              </p>
              <p>
                We made it through this 8 month long test. Through all the
                trials and joy of this expedition, we deepened our commitment to
                each other and created our band, Tennis.
