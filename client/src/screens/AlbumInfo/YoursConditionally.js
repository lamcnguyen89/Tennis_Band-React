                    <br />
                    There we linger 'til you fill right up

                    Parted lips instead of paper cups

                    <br />
                    Spreading out into the tiny space

                    Guess I left my head up in the clouds
                    <br />
                    I never accepted all your reasons

                    I will wait in the background
                    <br />
                    Working alone, working to hold in this feeling
                    <br />
                    Give me your hand, make me a man

                    Working alone, working to hold in this feeling
                    <br />
                    So give me your hand, make me a man
                    <br />
                    If you feel like you mean it
                    <br />

                    Happiness leaves me yearning
                    <br />
                    Tell me that you feel it too
                    <br />
                    If you see me hurting, you'll know
                    <br />
                    Happiness can leave you cold
                    <br />

                  <p>
                    Standing alone, standing alone, lonely wingman
                    <br />
                    I will wait in the background
                    <br />
                    Working alone, working to hold in this feeling
                    <br />

                    <br />

                    <br />
                    I will go where my body is leading
                    <br />
                    I never accepted all your reasons
                    <br />
                    So give me your hand, make me a man
                    <br />
                    In the heat of the evening

                    The earth in bloom
                    <br />
                    It's delicate and new
                    <br />

                    Wings are flying 'cross the sky
                    <br />
                    Why can't I dream my way?
                    <br />
                    Through the living and breathing and dreaming

                    On the faces in the spring
                    <br />
                    Never to feel a thing
                    <br />
